This is a simple web app for deleting some diacritics from Arabic text.

## Use cases
 - Some fonts or systems do not support these diacritics sufficiently.
 - The diacritics can be difficult to read if the font size is too small.

## Details about Diacritics
Diacritics are marks that go above or below a letter in a writing system that
are not really part of the letter.

In Arabic, these diacritics indicate short vowels, gemination, a grammatical
morpheme for indefiniteness, and a lack of a vowel. There is also one diacritic
for a long vowel that is removed.

The diacritics that are removed are:
- سكُون
- ٌشَدَّة
- فَتْحَةٌ
- كَسْرَةٌ
- ضَمَّةٌ
- فَتْحَتَانِ
- كَسْرَتَانِ
- ضَمَّتَانِ
